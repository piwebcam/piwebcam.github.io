## PiWebcam

With PiWebcam you can turn a Raspberry Pi into a fully-featured, dummy-proof Webcam with just one click.

Even if there are already around a number of projects for using a Raspberry Pi as a webcam, they often require advanced knowledge and skills and look like more ad-hoc solutions rather than finite, reusable products.

PiWebcam is intended to provide a powerful imaging platform for everyone, regardless of his/her previous knowledge.

An installation script will take care of fully configuring the system with reasonable default settings and thanks to its powerful motion detection feature, augmented by an object recognition capabilities, PiWebcam can notify the user by sending the motion picture to an e-mail recipient or a Slack channel.
